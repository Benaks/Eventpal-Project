## Installation

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eventrybe.git
   cd eventrybe/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   - Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create a new database for the app.
   - Update the database settings in `backend/settings.py`.

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'your_db_name',
           'USER': 'your_db_user',
           'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '5432',
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Start the Django server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
```

For the frontend, you might need to set up environment variables for API endpoints:

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/
```

## Running the App

To run the app, start both the frontend and backend servers. The frontend will interact with the backend APIs to provide a full event management experience.

```bash
# In one terminal, run the frontend:
cd frontend
npm start

# In another terminal, run the backend:
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```
